# TODO: Fix YouTube Videos Not Showing

## Problem

- YouTube sync is working (videos are being synced from YouTube)
- Videos don't show because SermonCard only links to YouTube instead of embedding/playing them

## Solution

Add modal/lightbox to SermonCard component to embed and play YouTube videos inline

## Steps
- [x] Update SermonCard.tsx to add video modal/lightbox functionality
- [x] Verify database connection (MONGODB_URI is configured)
